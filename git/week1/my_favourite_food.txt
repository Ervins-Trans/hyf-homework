This might be not the favourite meal of mine, but it was the most recent dish i've made.

Ingredients
455 g dried spaghetti
2 cloves garlic
extra virgin olive oil
1-2 dried red chillies (substituted for chilli sauce, store ran out of anything else. Used 1tsp)
400 g peeled raw prawns , from sustainable sources, ask your fishmonger
1 small wineglass white wine
2 heaped tablespoons sun-dried tomato purée , or 6 sun-dried tomatoes blitzed in a blender
1 lemon
2 handfuls of rocket (swapped to ruccola, cause i can)

Method
Cook your spaghetti in a large pan of salted boiling water according to the packet instructions.

Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the garlic. Heat 3 good lugs of extra virgin olive oil in a large frying pan,
then toss in the garlic and crumble in the chilli.
As the garlic begins to colour, add the prawns and sauté them for a minute. Add the white wine and tomato purée,
 and simmer for a couple of minutes.

Grate the zest of the lemon and roughly chop the rocket. When the pasta is ready, drain it in a colander,
reserving a little of the cooking water.

Toss the spaghetti with the sauce, squeeze in the lemon juice, add half the chopped rocket,
adding a little of the reserved cooking water if you want to loosen the sauce a bit,
and correct the seasoning with sea salt and black pepper.

Divide between 4 plates and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest and the rest of the rocket leaves.
